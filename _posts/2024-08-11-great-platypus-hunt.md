I am running Deep Carbon Observatory again, this time in 5e. The players have expressed an interest in hunting the infamous *Alpha Platypus*. So, in preparation for our next session, I used John B.'s ["Running Technical Plots"](https://retiredadventurer.blogspot.com/2016/08/running-technical-plots.html), plus some light research into medieval hunting and platypus behaviour, to figure out how what that would entail. John's framework was great for generating ideas to fill out and structure the adventure. As you'll see below, it might be less than ideal for actually organizing the information. Oh well. Here it is!

## Problem
Locate the Alpha Platypus!

## Platypus Facts
(and Nature DCs to know them):
**DC 11:**
- Nocturnal hunters
- Venomous
**DC 13:**
- Usually feeds on prey small enough to fit in its beak
- Despite being noctural, they sometimes emerge to hunt on overcast days.
- Need air to breathe, can't stay underwater for long periods
- Their venom isn't deadly to humans, but it can inflict agonizing pain.
- Sleep in burrows.
**DC 15:**
- Electrosensitive in the front and below -- uses this rather than vision to hunt.
- The venom is delivered using the hind legs.
- Burrows are usually found close to *but above* water. This means the flood has likely forced the Alpha to relocate.

## Adventure-Specific Details
- The Alpha Platypus's burrow has indeed flooded. Its old burrow was located near Pollnagollum, just south of the Log Tableaux. The new one, still shallow, is furth downriver, a few miles upstream of Pollnacrom.
- The Alpha is known to many of the locals, although rarely spotted. Most fishermen know to avoid the vicinity of its old burrow.
- If the Crows get word of the hunt, they will use the Platypus as bait for an ambush (see below).

## Examinations
- **Asking in Pollnacrom:** The villagers will be disinclined to help the party with the hunt unless they get rid of the Golem first. The local fishers all know the approximate location of its former burrow, having learned to avoid it. One fisher by the name of **Curi Qale** will agree to guide the party there if they promise she can have its meat.
- **Asking in Pollnagollum:** Similar to Pollnacrom. The villagers can't remember the Witch and so won't ask for help, but all have firm rationalizations to refuse to get near the water. Local fishers or hunters, if fed, will volunteer that the Platypus makes its burrow about an hour's ride downriver along the north bank, just after the turn. If they like the party, they may add that the flood likely washed it out. Local eccentric **Gudenus** is fascinated with the thing and can answer most questions about its behaviour.
- **Oswald Bone-Norman's Family at the Lifesaving Library** *fucking saw the thing* swimming downstream shortly after setting up on the outcrop. If the Crows have captured it, they saw that too, and have a 50% chance of having been murdered for it (add them to the tally of zombies).
- **Locating its burrows:** Finding either burrow is a DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check if searching at random within about a mile of it, or DC 10 if searching purposefully with good information.
- **Searching for tracks between its burrows:** DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) to reveal tracks through shoreline and shallows (decreases by 2 per successive hour spent searching to a minimum of 10, but *increases* by 2 for every day passed since the flood). A failure against DC 10 or the DC reaching 30 means the tracks can no longer be detected by normal means.

## Apparatuses
- **Speaking with animals:** The Drowned Lands are teeming with aquatic life that can be coaxed into talking with a bit of food. Older fish and various other aquatic animals have a chance in 6 based on proximity of knowing the direction of a of its former nest or present whereabouts.
- **Seeking out bait:** There is no shortage of attractive bait to be found. Anything the size of a small dog or larger will do. Electric eels are especially enticing, and can be found nesting around the **eel trees**.
- **Netting:** In addition to catching bait, a cleverly deployed net can help trap the Platypus in its burrow (for a while). The few fishing nets salvaged from the flood in Pollnacrom and Pollnagollum are largely being used by survivors to catch food. They will not part with them willingly. One can be found in the eel trees. A throrough, full-day search of any tile of shoreline has a 1:4 chance of turning up a usable net.

## Activations
- **Active search:** Whenever the party spends an hour searching for or tracking the Platypus within 2 tiles of its burrow, roll an additional d20 when checking for encounters: The Platypus appears on a 19-20. If a PC is actively on the lookout for it, apply their Perception modifier (if advantageous): Success on a natural roll of less than 19 means they spot it before it notices them.
- **Large, live bait** strategically placed in its vicinity has a 50% chance to attract it if used in the same tile while it is hunting (75% chance if a huge electric eel is used). Dead bait is not electroactive and only has a 10% chance of attracting it. Lures can also be used near its burrow, where it may notice them upon returning in the morning.
	-  The Platypus has learned not to attack armed groups of humans on sight, but it will make probing attacks against humans getting in its way and hunt solitary ones (especially if they are in the water).
	- Nevertheless, it will hunt groups of humans despite its better instincts if it is very hungry (1:6).
- **Fighting it in water from a boat:** The Platypus will begin by ramming it. Smaller craft have a 50% chance of capsizing. Otherwise, everyone on board must make a Dexterity Save or get knocked over (into the water if possible). The Platypus will target swimming prey before 
- **Attacking it in its burrow:** In many ways, this is where it is most vulnerable as it has little room to turn around. It cannot use its venom if attacked from the front. However, the burrow is tight (only about 6' high and about as wide), making it impossible to use large swinging weapons.
- **Fighting the Platypus:** Unless trapped or hunting (1:6), the Platypus never fights to death, instead fleeing into the nearest body of water when reduced to 50%. hp.

## The Crows
If the Crows get word of the Platypus hunt (which they certainly will if the party mentions it in Pollnagollum or Pollnacrom), they will attempt to use the hunt to stage an ambush.

Their plan is to use the Platypus as a lure, and it will be ready in 1d3 days:
- The Crows capture the Platypus.
- Using *Speak with Animals*, Zolushika convinces the Platypus the PCs pose a threat to its life. The Platypus, already disturbed by the flood, will agree to help the Crows.
- The Crows set up an ambush site (as per DCO#8).
- The night before the ambush, the Crows will stage a series of sleep deprivation attacks -- a constant string of zombies, provoking
- The Platypus goes hunting somewhere in plain sight, visible to the PCs shortly after they set out for the day.
	- Anyone knowledgeable about Platypus behaviour (DC 12) will find this odd as it is nocturnal -- the most obvious explanation is it's very hungry. However, a perceptive observer (DC 15) will notice it is hunting lazily given the bounty of food around it. 
- Once the Platypus is confident they are approaching it, it begins to flee towards the ambush site. This draws it onto land. (Again, this is suspicious behaviour.)
- Once the PCs are in the killing field, a handful of zombies will emerge to divide their attacks. Ghar will fire. HÃ¶olloch and Echo will join shortly thereafter.
	- If the PCs came by boat, a zombie clinging to its underside will push it out shortly after they disembark.
