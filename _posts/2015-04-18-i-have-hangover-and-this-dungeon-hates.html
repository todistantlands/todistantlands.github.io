<p dir="ltr">Last night I overindulged and now my everything feels gross. <a href="http://justanotherdungeon.blogspot.de">Sherief Gaber</a> wants ideas for ways to make his players miserable without making them fight things. Turns out these things go well together. Here's my response.</p><p dir="ltr"><i>Simple things:</i></p><p dir="ltr"><i>A river to cross, and no bridges or boats (danger of being swept away, metal rusts, paper ruined, food rations ruined, excess weight increases chances of drowning)</i></p><p dir="ltr"><i>A rainy night and a bad tent (again, damaged equipment, but also risk of hypothermia, and it's more or less impossible to sleep well, if at all, when your bed roll is soaked)</i></p><p dir="ltr"><i>In the morning after all this bullshit you discover several poisonous spiders have laid eggs in your armour. Do you dare try to get them out?</i></p><p dir="ltr"><i>Also in dungeons everything that takes time also uses up light (and vice versa. Light is dungeon-time.) Fill the darkness with awful things.</i></p><p dir="ltr"><i>The bridge across the underground chasm is long and weak. It looks like it can just barely support one lightly - encumbered person at a time, and they'd better not run. Also something is snoring below.</i></p><p dir="ltr"><i>And good luck getting all your stuff through that crawlspace. And mind the stalagmites, they're sharp.</i></p><p dir="ltr"><i>This hallway is flooded four feet deep.</i></p><p dir="ltr"><i>Basically just drown them.&#65279;</i></p>
