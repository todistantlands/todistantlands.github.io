Alright folks, I've been hanging around Discord a while and thinking about what kind of server I'd like to be in, and I think it's time I made it happen. Link after the jump.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a>But first, some rules:<br /><br />Rule #1: don't be Bad<br />Rule #2: Please don't make me enforce rule #1<br />Rule #3: don't invite anyone, I hate everyoe<br />Rule #4: dON'T TALk to ME<br />Rule #5: DONT TOUCH ME<br />Rule #6: NNNNNNNO<br />Rule #7: hhhmNNNRRRRRRGGGG<br />Rule #8: after deep relflection and some time away, it is with a heavy heart that I announce that I will be closing the discord server
