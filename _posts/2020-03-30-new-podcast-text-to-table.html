It understands the act of taking RPG texts and bringing them to life in games as a task that is complex, skillful, expressive, and challenging. I speak with GMs about their experiences with various RPG products and topics, in order to get a better sense of how they bridge that seemingly endless gap between the thing on the page (or in your head) and the fantastical chaos of play.<br /><br />This first episode features David Wilkie / <a href="http://anxietywizard.blogspot.com/">Anxiety Wizard</a> as we talk about Troika, its colourful archetypes, and the wide-open campaign affordances of its rules and setting.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy. Feel free to shoot me any questions/comments/feedback here or by email at alexichalk@gmail.com. If you enjoy, please share, as I'm not on RPG twitter and therefore somewhat limited in my ability to reach listeners. Also please let me know if there's a topic you'd like to see addressed, or if you have insights you might be interested in sharing on the show yourself!
