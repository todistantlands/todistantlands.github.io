## Downtime

Prospero the Violet goes carousing and has a divine visition with the following vision: Mountains overlooking Cuccagna. One big red mountain with a greek-style temple going into it. Inside: Face of a statue of a handsome youth (below) sculped in shock-white. Eyes of a serpent.

More importantly, he gains a level!! Sweet!!!

## Then we go dungeon
We make for the 1st floor, but along the way our scout encounters a **Scitalis** and gets paralyzed by its hypnotic eyes. We close in to fight, Prospero the Violet and Graciela averting their gazes. Wren does not protect their vision and falls victim to its ability. The porter Pero steps up to join the fray, earning a promotion to the role of bravo. After a few rounds of fighting we kill it!

Hooray!

### Ok 1st floor
We head north from the entrance and have our thief examine a door. He finds that it's trapped: there are two holes in the ceiling just before the doorway. The thief mentions with some flour and water he might be able to plug the holes and block whatever might come out. We decide to come back later.

We check out another room. It is full of empty weapon racks and armour stands, but nothing of apparent value.

Exploring westward we come upon a hallway lined with green slime. Poking it with a 10' pole suggests it is not the infamous green slime of dungeon lore. It smells like Pine-Sol. Upon inspection, it appears to coming through some seam between the wall and floor.

John Napkin tries to locate the seam and pry it open. He succeeds in sliding the wall (revealed to be false) upward, exposing a passage lined with slime running southward. The slime runs down a passage to another wall. We suspect this may be the slime from the vats.

We begin spiking the door. After some time we see **green slime** come burbling through the far seam in the wall. This time it is the monster kind! John Napkin quickly unspikes the door.

Wren gets curious and tries to burn the floor slime with a torch. It burns slowly and acridly like green wood. While this is happening the monster ooze slides under the door. It retreats from the flame back under seam!

Hooray!

### Nothing bad will happen to us
We explore some more. Idk hallways and stuff. We thought it might link back up to the vat room but instead seems to wrap around it.

Too much hallway! We open another door.

The room beyond contains some kind of *circular diagram* as well, more urgently, as **6 backwards-face Blemmyes**. They attack on site!

### The Last Heading Was A Lie!! Climactic Battle Against the Blemmyes!! Will We Lose Our Lives?!
They batter our front line with spears, wounding Dame Losaneta. Wren casts Sleep, only putting out one of the Blemmyes (and revealing they have two hit dice).

We engage them in missile combat. It's not going great!

Prospero the Violet casts Phantasmal Force, conjuring an illusion of a giant spiked roller thingy trundling across the room, crushing the Blemmyes. One passes his save against the illusion and keeps fighting us.

John Napkin tries to parley with the survivor but it does not appear to speak our language.

Dame Losaneta drops the last Blemmye, and we quickly dispatch the rest.

Hooray!

### Mmmmmmakin magic circle ooooh baby magic circle ooh
Prospero the Violet binds Losaneta's wounds. He then studies the magical circle. It appears to be for summoning. He notices that nothing has passed inside of it. He takes a sheet of parchment and copies the circle for further study.

We surmise from the surviving Blemmye not having fled that there are no secret exits.

I was getting very sleepy near the end and stopped taking notes. Sorry about any gaps.
