[Matt](http://www.hexculture.com), some other folks on Discord, and I, have been talking about what makes NPCs in Zelda games feel so vivid, despite how thinly sketched they often are. I'm talking minor NPCs here, like the travelling Goron who sells you gems or the alligator in the house who wants a banana.

For my money, the most important thing is that NPCs be _extremely on their bullshit._ This means:
- They have something they are very interested in.
- They have something that is of interest or value to you.
- They are not interested in you or your goals.

The tables below should help you sketch out NPCs in this style. Sometimes you might need to tie in an adventure hook from your campaign, but these weirdos are pretty good at implying their own.

**One line NPC hyperfixations**
1. Collects something rare but not necessarily valuable
2. A magic item in their possession
3. A magic item not in their possession
4. A legendary monster or hero
5. Craving a specific kind of food
6. Heard an extremely inaccurate rumour
7. A dangerous location or local landmark
8. A location no one else knows about
9. A portent or omen
10. A household malfunction happening right in front of you
11. A pet or species of animal
12. A special trinket or gadget
13. A weird feature of the landscape
14. A local game or custom
15. The latest fad
16. Another NPC's activities
17. Something belonging to one of the PCs
18. A missing belonging
19. Arguing with another NPC about (roll again)
20. Eagerly gossiping with another NPC about (roll again), do not wish to be disturbed
{: .random-table}

**They are hyperfixating on this because they want...**
1. To impress their crush
2. To impress their crush (you)
3. To become rich
4. To prove someone wrong
5. To get revenge on someone
6. To be left alone
7. To rescue someone or something dear to them
8. Sheer curiosity
9. To expose their rival
10. To clear their name
11. To topple some local authority
12. They have been misinformed and believe that it will help them (roll again)...
{: .random-table}

**Attitude towards the PCs:**
1. Lackadaisical
2. Baffled
3. Furious
4. Scamming
5. Obsequious
6. Skeptical
7. Desperate
8. Fawning
9. Envious
10. Amused
11. Doesn't seem to notice them
12. Mistake them for someone else with whom they are (roll again)

Have fun!

P.S. - these tables were automated using [the Tablifier](https://todistantlands.github.io/2022/12/26/tablifier.html), a javascript thingy I wrote for rapidly automating plaintext lists. Give it a shot!
