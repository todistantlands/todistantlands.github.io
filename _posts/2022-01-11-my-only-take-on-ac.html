<p>I can't believe I'm even writing about ascending/descending AC. Blame <a href="http://chiquitafajita.blogspot.com/">Marcia</a>, who's doing <a href="https://chiquitafajita.blogspot.com/2021/10/chainmails-weapon-statistics-for-od.html">some fascinating work with the old Chainmail tables</a>.</p><p>Look, here's my only take on ascending AC:</p><p>If you're using AC to reference a table, don't express AC as a number. You can use letters! Letter grade AC! It makes it so much less confusing when the number on the sheet is separate from the number you're rolling against.</p><p>So here we go: Unarmoured = D, Leather = C, Chain = B, Plate = A</p><p>If there's a shield, you get a +. So Plate + Shield = A+.</p><p>That's it. That's the take.</p><p></p>
