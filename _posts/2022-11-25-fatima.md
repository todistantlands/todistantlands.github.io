The only certain thing about Fatima is she has been around since the Castle was built, for contemporary accounts place her in Emperor's entourage in those days. The Emperor always kept her close, her rooms the nearest to the royal apartments, or her tend neighbouring his on campaign. She is in every play and painting of the ceremonies of castle life, always just off center, just outside the action, often holding a candle. The few living artists who can explain their work simply cite artistic tradition.

Lately, she is often seen around the throneroom. People give her wide berth, and do not ask questions, for the only word she is known to speak is the true name of death.
