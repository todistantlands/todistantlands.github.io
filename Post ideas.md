## Microblog about this quote
>Experience awards for defeating [monsters](https://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#monsters_2) are scaled according to the ratio of the [dungeon](https://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) level to the character level so that higher level players are encouraged to seek appropriate challenges. If a party of 1st level characters were to defeat a dozen 1 HD [orcs](https://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs) on the 1st [dungeon](https://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) level they would be awarded 1,200 XP between them. If a party of 6th level characters defeated the same [orcs](https://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#orcs) they would earn one-sixth as many XP because they are 6th level characters exploring the 1st [dungeon](https://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#populating-a-dungeon) level.
