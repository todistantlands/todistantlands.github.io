## What is this?
This is a sequel to the [Recursive Encounter Calculator](https://todistantlands.github.io/2019/06/17/the-recursive-encounter-calculator-for.html).

Basically I realized that the Encounter Calculator method works great if you're rolling physical dice -- you use the percentage to determine whether an outcome is confirmed at all, and then a second roll to determine when.

But say you just need to roll a bunch of dice until you get a result. This will do that (up to a maximum of 100 rolls), and then tell you how many rolls it took.

That's all! Enjoy!
