So when we last played most of us (besides Petra) had been put to sleep by gas and caught in nets. Luckily two new adventurers immediately showed up! 

We are attacked by **big white rats with crossbows** but drive them off. Then the changeling detects a secret door to the west. Beyond the door is a *mermaid statue*. Looking at it makes Graciella starts shrieking. In order to calm her we go look for another room to loot.

We hear the sounds of **Blemmyes** coming from the south so we decide to check out a room to the west. Inside there is a <u>crystal ball</u>. Graciela approaches this and sees a woman robed in indigo[^1]. The woman looks back at her, causing Graciela's nose to bleed for 3 damage. Prospero the Violet staunches the nosebleed. Upon further consideration, he concludes that the crystal ball could sell for about 250 gp and would lose its power if removed from its stand. Furthermore, he could conceal himself from it and block its attack with a *Protection from Evil* spell.

We check out another room further north where previously we heard a serpentine hiss. Expecting a snake, Kane and Dame Losaneta take the front while Prospero the Violet prepares a Light spell. In the dark beyond our torchlight, Petra spies a **ten-foot snake with little wings** sticking out of its back. Beyond the snake is a little sitting room table, some old furniture. The table is piled with <u> gems</u>.

Prospero the Blue slides his glowing knife into the room provoking the snake to produce a hypnotic pattern. Several of us fall prey it spell. Upon its approach we see it also has cropped ears like a little dog.

The team peppers the snake with missiles, causing it to retreat. Pressing our advantage, we pursue, slowly chipping away at it with arrows. We get bored of missing and close in for melee. Kain charges, and Antonio uses the froglings' signature leap attack.

We collect the treasure: <u>10 amethyst cabuchons (2500 gp)</u>.

We debate whether to cash out and decide to explore one more room. 

We come to a hall lined with alcoves full of *man-sized statues.* We quickly identify these to be petrified people like the ones outside, but unlike the servile theme of the orchard, these all appear to be adventurers. We deem this to be where Prospero the Blue keeps interlopers. They include a thief, a fighter, a battle-nun, and a knight.[^2] We have the porters haul away the thief.

We check out another room nearby and find it to be a pantry. Nothing of interest.

Ok NOW we cash out.

**Deaths**
- No one! :)

**Treasure**
- 10 amethyst cabuchons
- petrified thief

**Monsters Defeated**
- Scitalis (the snake thing)

**New Friends and/or Enemies**
- None :(

**Open Loops**
- Is there any way to safely deal with yellow mold?
- Did Calibanâ€™s notes include any instructions or command words for controlling the glass men?
- There are stairs up and down... which way is more dangerous?
- What can we learn about the mushrooms?
- we should steal that crystal ball

[^1]: Presumably **Prospera the Indigo**
[^2]: I'm reasonably sure there were actually between 5 and 7 statues in total but we didn't study all of them.
