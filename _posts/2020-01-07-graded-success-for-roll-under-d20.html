This is a sort of half-baked add-on inspired by Call of Cthulhu 7e's graded difficulty system for roll-under d100 resolution. It assumes 3d6-based ability generation a la BX, and uses the same modifier scale, albeit towards a different end.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />Basically, any ability score rated 3-18 has a "crit" range from 1 to (4 + ability modifier):*<br /><br /><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><th>Ability Score</th><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><th>Crit threshold</th><td align="center">1</td><td align="center" colspan="2">2</td><td align="center" colspan="3">3</td><td align="center" colspan="4">4</td><td align="center" colspan="3">5</td><td align="center" colspan="2">6</td><td align="center">7</td></tr></tbody></table><br />You could also implement a simple skill system:<br /><br />UNSKILLED:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss: Goes badly<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Success: Works, at a cost.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Crit: Works<br />COMPETENT:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss: Doesn't work - can push at risk<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Success: Works<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Crit: Works well<br />SKILLED:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss: Works at a cost<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Success: Works<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Crit: Works well<br /><br />So what to do with all this? I dunno there's plenty of good games out there, play one of those instead. You're welcome.
