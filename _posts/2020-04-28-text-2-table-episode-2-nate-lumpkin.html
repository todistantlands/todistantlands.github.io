His blog has been one of my favourites since the heyday of G+ and I'm super excited whenever a new post shows up in my feed. Nate is talented writer with a good mind for D&amp;D, and it was really fun to get to speak to him about his campaign.</div><div><br /></div><div>I faced a number of technical issues putting this one together, a couple of which were my fault but most of which really lie with the platform, Anchor. These are reflected in the nearly month-long gap between episodes, and in the audio quality of the interview itself. It's alright if you want to get something out quick and don't care to edit, but neither of those things describe me and I found it to be really hostile to work with. I haven't made any firm decisions yet but am exploring alternative hosting services, cause damn.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, enjoy the conversation. I liked having it and I think there's some really interesting material in there.</div>
